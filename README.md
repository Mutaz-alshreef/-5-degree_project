# 🤖 5-DOF Robotic Arm (3D Design)

This project features a **5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) Robotic Arm** designed using 3D modeling tools. It serves as a conceptual prototype for a robotic manipulator capable of complex positioning and movement in space.

## 🛠 Project Overview

A 5-DOF robotic arm includes:
- **Base Rotation (Yaw)**
- **Shoulder Pitch**
- **Elbow Pitch**
- **Wrist Pitch**
- **Wrist Roll**

Each joint adds a degree of freedom, allowing the arm to reach and manipulate objects in a 3D workspace.

## 🧩 Components (Virtual Design)

- Cylindrical segments representing arm links
- Spherical joints (or hinge-like connections)
- A claw/gripper placeholder at the end-effector
- A stable round base

Design created using:
- [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) (or compatible 3D CAD software)

## 🎯 Applications

This model can serve as the base for:
- Educational robotics
- Pick-and-place automation
- Inverse kinematics learning
- Simulated control system development

## 🔁 Possible Enhancements

- Add actuators (servo motors) in simulation
- Export design for 3D printing
- Integrate with Arduino or Raspberry Pi for physical prototype
- Apply inverse kinematics using software libraries (e.g., Python or MATLAB)
